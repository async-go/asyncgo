## What are Teams

Teams are the base collection in AsyncGo and represent one group of users who collaborate. Teams are
billed individually based on the number of members.

## Managing Teams

From the Teams page you are able to add and remove users. A few important notes on users:

- Users must be individually invited from the Teams page
- There are no limitations on domain name as to who can be invited to the team
- An individual user, as defined by one email address, may only be a member of one team

In the future we are considering adding support for having one user be part of more than one team,
and also adding pre-approval for anyone who joins from a given domain name. Let us know if these
features are important to you.
