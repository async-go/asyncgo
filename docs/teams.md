# Teams

Teams in AsyncGo represent one group of users who collaborate with each other.
Teams are billed as one unit, based on the total number of members.

## Managing Teams

From the Teams page you are able to add and remove users. A few important notes:

- Users must be individually invited from the Teams page
- There are no limitations on domain name as to who can be invited to the team
- An individual user, as defined by one email address, may only be a member of
  one team
