## Before you Start

If you aren't sure what async working is, check out our [resources on what it means to work asynchronously](/async.html).

## Important Concepts

AsyncGo is oriented around temporary **topics** that are created, typically from a pre-existing meeting or issue, that can
represent any discussion topic that needs to be had.

When a topic is created, it is configured with a description, participants, and an end date/time.

## Creating Topics

From the topic list, simply click on "New Topic" to create a topic. You will be prompted to enter a description and can also
invite participants.

Topic descriptions set the table for the conversation to be had, and are very important.

Topic descriptions also support markdown in order to include descriptive elements such as images, checklists, and more.
See our [markdown reference](markdown.html) for more details.
