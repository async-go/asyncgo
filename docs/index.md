## Introduction

Welcome to AsyncGo! AsyncGo helps your team communicate flexibly and without
the interruptions caused by meetings and chat:

- Your **topic board** becomes the "office water cooler" to find out what's being discussed.
- **Timeboxed discussions** help everyone know what to focus on next.
- Embedded **facilitation tools** helps everyone get to great results quickly.
- **Structured context** and **outcomes** ensure discussions begin and end with clarity.
- Use meeting time for **human connection**. Try a coffee chat instead!

## Async Working

The first step to getting the most out of AsyncGo is to familiarize yourself with async working.

Async is a way of working, useful for remote, colocated, or hybrid companies, where collaboration is done via a digital workspace
rather than in synchronous meetings/discussions. This gives the flexibility for any team member to choose
their own workday based on when they like to focus or have other commitments.

Here are some good places to learn more about async work:

## Key Concepts

AsyncGo was designed for asynchronous work, which means the app will not hound you for updates.
You won't find phone notifications, loud indicators in the app, constant email reminders, or anything
like that. Instead, the application is designed to be interacted with on your own schedule, with
gentle reminders on a slower cadence.

This can be initially hard to adjust to if you're used to interrupt-driven, realtime work, but once
you're used to it, it's quite easy. There are just a few key concepts to understand:

### Timeboxing

We recommend setting a due date on nearly every item. Setting a due date helps your team members
know when they need to reply by. Most users work down the topic list from the ones coming due most soon
to the furthest out, in order to make sure they have a chance to contribute to the topics they are
interested in.

This lets everyone manage their own time to decide what they want to focus on at any given point,
while having the confidence that they won't miss out.

Note that due dates are at the end of the chosen day. If you want something to be due at end of day
Monday, then you should choose Monday as the date. If, instead, you want it to be due at midnight on
Sunday, you should choose Sunday instead.

### Clear Communication

Because you aren't meeting as a team and kicking things off with a general Q&A session, at least
via the app, it's important to write a very clear description that sets the table for the problem
at hand. Include links to relevant documentation, sources, and issues, and in general try to not
assume any context from the reader. This will also help you later when the topic is reviewed to see
how a decision was made.

You can also apply some initial structure to the outcome, indicating the format of what you're
looking for in the end. That can also help focus the team and ensure they understand what you
are asking for.

If you are the kind of person who likes to lay things out with spoken words, you can always record audio
or video and [embed it](#video) into the description, outcome, or a comment. Note that embedded videos
are not auto-transcribed, so are not searchable.

### Slower-Paced Notifications

The primary way to be notified about what's going on in AsyncGo is via digest notifications. These
are meant to be reviewed a couple of times per day, at your convenience, and highlight what's new since
your last visit, as well as any items that are coming due soon.

In this way you aren't constantly being interrupted to respond to the latest reply in a conversation
thread, like you might be in a regular chat application. Also, since your collaborators aren't expecting
immediate replies, it helps everyone be in the right mindset.

This may feel like you're slowing down overall, but it just isn't the case. By working on several
topics simultaneously, rather than serially as you would in meetings, you actually get more done.
While it's true that any individual item may take slightly longer, the overall productivity is
much higher. In any case, if something is urgent and needed right away, it's always possible to
reach out to the person directly.. but this should be saved for real urgent situations, because
whenever you do this you're impacting the team's async flow.

## Monitoring throughput and productivity

A common question from managers working with remote teams for the first time is how to know if
your team members are really working, or how to tell if they are taking the opportunity of being away from the
office to avoid work. 

The reality is that most people increase rather than decrease the amount of
work done when moving to remote, since the lines between personal and work life can become blurred.
As a manager you'll be better off spending your time helping your team establish these
boundaries in order to avoid burn out and ensure everyone is well rested and at their best.

That said, of course occasionally you will have performance issues with someone. Although it
may be tempting in this case to want to track the hours they are spending logged in and active,
that's at best only a secondary, poor version of what you should actually be measuring: the
outcomes they deliver. This is complex enough that it requires engagement between the manager
and employee who needs help, and isn't something that a metric here would help. If you're
interested in this topic you can read our [blog post on how to think about productivity for remote teams](https://asyncgo.com/blog/leadership/2020/02/05/measuring-remote-productivity.html)

Because of this, we don't plan to have metrics in AsyncGo about individual performance. Instead,
we will add metrics that speak to overall team activity and collaboration. You can expect to see these in an
upcoming release, in the meantime we'd love your feedback on what you're looking for.

## Practical Usage

AsyncGo is designed to make it easy to get up and running with your team. It doesn't require getting
rid of any of the other tools you use, though you may decide to do so later, and it doesn't require
changing any of the behaviors of anyone outside your team.

Within your team, there are three main applications that adopting AsyncGo will change your usage of.

### Reducing usage of video conferencing (Zoom, Teams, etc.) and meetings

The first and most fundamental - don't schedule that meeting that you're considering having, especially
if the meeting is within your own team. Instead, open up a new topic and place the meeting agenda there.

If you're including someone from outside of your team, then you have a decision to make. If you think
the person is up for participating then you can always invite them to your team. From that point on
they will be able to participate as a normal user.

With all your free time that you've freed up from meetings, consider scheduling a coffee chat or two
with someone that you'd like to have a more free-form, human conversation with. It's a much better
use of your time than work meetings where everyone is staring at documents or quietly working on
something else in the background.

### Replacing ongoing discussion agendas (Google Docs, Notion, etc.)

With AsyncGo, you also don't need a register of topics that are in discussion. A lot of companies use a
Google Doc for this, with a long list of topics that they keep coming back to and/or archive off for
later reference. Instead, use the topic list in AsyncGo itself to keep track of all the various things
you're discussing.

One of the most powerful features of AsyncGo is how the complete list of discussion topics is right there
for anyone to see, and they can choose to participate at any time if they have something to contribute.

### Reducing usage of chat (Slack, IRC, etc.)

Chat is an insidious one. It almost feels async, but anyone who has felt overwhelmed at the pace of
threads happening in chat will attest to the fact that it's more realtime than they'd let you believe.
To get the most out of AsyncGo, whenever there's a deeper topic that you want to give time for people
to reflect on and participate at their convenience, don't start a Slack discussion. Instead create a
new topic in AsyncGo and link to it from your channel.

Realtime chat is great for the things it's good at, which is quick clarifying questions and short
interactions, so try to save it for that. Avoid it for deeper thought.

### How to tell you've got it right

You shouldn't worry about this too much, the benefit will be felt by everyone once you make the change.
That said, some good practical measurements are:

- How much time is spent in meetings per week
- Uninterrupted focus blocks and duration per day
- Reduced messages in chat

If these measures aren't improving, it's time to look at where the interruptions are coming from.
If they are coming from other teams, you could consider including the high-contact ones into
AsyncGo as well, then work together on creating focus time together. In most companies there
are just a few sources of interruptions that, when dealt with, reduce the total interruptions
dramatically.

## Topics

AsyncGo is oriented around temporary **topics** that are created, typically from a pre-existing meeting or issue, that can
represent any discussion topic that needs to be had. A topic is meant to exist for a short period of time during which
everyone contributes their thoughts.

At the end the discussion is resolved and the final outcomes and/or decisions are recorded.

### The Topic List

When you log in you'll see a list of open topics. From here you can click on any of the available topics
to participate.

### Creating Topics

From the topic list click on "New Topic" to create a topic. You will be prompted to enter a description and a title.
Topic descriptions set the table for the conversation to be had and are very important. You can use [markdown](markdown.html)
to enter richer content than plain text; we recommend including a checklist of key points to discuss, which can be marked
off as you go, and potentially an embedded video recording to help set the context.

Topics can also have a due date set, which will be made visible to everyone looking at the topic index. This can be a
great way to communicate when you need something by, and help everyone prioritize the topics they engage with.

### Collaborating on Topics

Once the topic is set up you can share it with everyone who you want to participate. Everyone can collaborate async as
you go, discussing the topic at hand until you reach your outcome.

### Voting in Topics

You can vote on any comment inside of a topic by adding whatever emoji you like. Good examples are thumbs ups and thumbs
down, to indicate approval or disapproval, but you can be creative and show your support in lots of different ways. One
bit of advice - if you disapprove, follow up on your emoji with another comment to explain why.

You can also use emojis to do more complex votes with multiple options. In this case, use a different emoji for each
option in the vote.

### Resolving Topics

Now that your topic is complete you can mark it as resolved. This will freeze further edits.

A good idea for confirming everyone is onboard with the final outcome is to add a comment asking everyone if they
are ready to finalize the outcome. They can then add thumbs up emojis to indicate their active support.

## Teams

Teams in AsyncGo represent one group of users who collaborate with each other. Teams are
billed as one unit, based on the total number of members.

### Managing Teams

From the Teams page you are able to add and remove users. A few important notes:

- Users must be individually invited from the Teams page
- There are no limitations on domain name as to who can be invited to the team
- An individual user, as defined by one email address, may only be a member of one team

---

## Markdown

AsyncGo uses [GFM markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for rich content, and supports all tags listed in their documentation.
There are a few common keywords used to support discussions which are highlighted here.

### Checklists

It's very helpful to use checklists to define the set of things you're going to discuss, and then you can mark them
off as you go. Checklists are entered as follows:

```
- [ ] An unchecked checkbox
- [x] A checked checkbox
```

### Bullet Lists

You can create bulleted lists using the following format:

```
- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
```

Sub-bullets are also possible, in that case you should use four spaces to indicate the next level of indent. You
can also mix and match bullet types in this way.

```
- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2
    1. Sub-item 1
    2. Sub-item 2
- Unordered item 3
    - Sub-item 1
    - Sub-item 2

### Links

Links can be added as follows:

```
[Link description](https://www.google.com)
```

### Images

Images are added similarly:

```
![foo](/url "https://www.google.com/with-my-image.png")
```

### Videos

Adding videos is done by adding images with links. Since it's not possible to embed the video directly, you show the video thumbnail instead as an image and then link to the video. With YouTube for example you would replace `VIDEO_ID` below with the actual video ID:

```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
```
