## Before you Start

If you aren't sure what async is or why it's important, check out our [resources on what it means to work asynchronously](/async.html).

## Important Concepts

AsyncGo is oriented around temporary **topics** that are created, typically from a pre-existing meeting or issue, that can
represent any discussion topic that needs to be had. A topic is meant to exist for a short period of time during which
everyone contributes their thoughts.

At the end the discussion is resolved and the final decision(s) are recorded.

## The Topic List

When you log in you'll see a list of open topics. From here you can click on any of the available topics
to participate.

## Creating Topics

From the topic list click on "New Topic" to create a topic. You will be prompted to enter a description and a title.
Topic descriptions set the table for the conversation to be had and are very important. You can use [markdown](markdown.html)
to enter richer content than plain text; we recommend including a checklist of key points to discuss, which can be marked
off as you go, and potentially an embedded video recording to help set the context.

## Collaborating on Topics

Once the topic is set up you can share it with everyone who you want to participate. Everyone can collaborate async as
you go, discussing the topic at hand until you reach your decision.

## Resolving Topics

Now that your topic is complete you can mark it as resolved. This will freeze further edits.

## Managing Teams

From the Teams page you are able to add and remove users.
