## Before you Start

If you aren't sure what async working is, check out our [resources on what it means to work asynchronously](/async.html).

## Important Concepts

AsyncGo is oriented around temporary **topics** that are created, typically from a pre-existing meeting or issue, that can
represent any discussion topic that needs to be had. A topic is meant to exist for a short period of time, during which
everyone contributes their thoughts.

At the end, the discussion is resolved and the final decision(s) are recorded.

## The Topic List

## Creating Topics

From the topic list, simply click on "New Topic" to create a topic. You will be prompted to enter a description and can also
invite participants.

### Setting up a good topic description

Topic descriptions set the table for the conversation to be had, and are very important. We recommend including an explicit list of
decisions you want to make, and also a date/time that you want to wrap up.

Topic descriptions also support markdown in order to include descriptive elements such as images, checklists, and more.
See our [markdown reference](markdown.html) for more details.
