## What is Async Working?

Async is a way of working, useful for remote, colocated, or hybrid companies, where collaboration is done via a digital workspace
rather than in syncronous meetings/discussions. This gives the flexibility for any team member to choose
their own workday based on when they like to focus or have other commitments.

Async can also be used even when you are in a single location, allowing for better use of your in-person time together than spent
in meetings.
