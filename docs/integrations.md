# Integrations

AsyncGo also includes integrations with other apps to make it easier to
integrate with your workflow.

## Browser Extensions

We offer browser extensions to make it easy to create topics from anywhere.
Right click on any page to create a topic with a reference back to that page, or
highlight some text and bring that over as well.

Our extensions are [open source](https://github.com/async-go/extensions).

## Authorization Providers

You can use several different accounts to log in to AsyncGo.Â We allow both
personal and business accounts to log in, but you'll need to ensure the email
address of the account you log in with matches the one you were invited with.

- Microsoft
- Google
- GitHub
- Slack

Note that your administrator can choose to limit authorization to external apps
within your organization. If that's the case you can contact them to allow
AsyncGo.
